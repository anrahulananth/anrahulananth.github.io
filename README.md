Hello!

This is my portfolio website. Built without using any framework with SASS.

Inspired by Brad Traversy's Portfolio Tutorial.

## Development

Use Liver Server VSCode Extension to serve the HTML and run the following command to build the CSS from SCSS

`code` npm run sass

Feel Free to use this in any way you want!
